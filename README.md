# Eclipse Bulk Import
## About
At my place of work, we have lots of eclipse projects. The base platform is composed of over 200 eclipse projects. Now, Iâ€™m not really sure if anyone ever uses eclipse with over 200 projects. There are some issues with such an eclipse setup:

1. Eclipse workspaces get corrupt every now and then: new workspace, import projects, wait. This cycle can take appox an hour and still lead to corrupt workspace. (once I spent an entire day doing this!)
2. Importing these projects takes time because you have to select a bunch of projects
3. Importing over 200 projects and then build takes eclipse appox 30-40 mins depending on the hardware
4. A functioning eclipse with over 200 projects is needed before one can do anything productive

And so after looking for such a plugin that would allow me to import a predefined list or projects, and not finding one, I decided to write one myself.

## Features
* saves the list of projects in the current workspace
* is able to bulk-import this list of projects in another or the same workspace
* can help to recover from corrupt workspaces


## Screen Shots
Here is an example to the plugin in action. In this video i remove some projects from my workspace. The plugin has already saved the list of current projects. So with one click, I can re-import them:

## Download
Download the plugin jar from the github here
Source is also here.

### Installation
Place the BulkImportPlugin_1.0.0.jar in your $eclipse_dir/plugins/ directory. Restart Eclipse.

## Usage
Once installed, you will have 2 buttons on the eclipse gui to:

1. Save the current list of projects
2. import projects from a saved list of projects

In Window -> Preferences -> Bulk Import you have some options as to where to save the project List and when it should be saved
